    "To briefly illustrate how this works, the code block below sets up a simple search system using ChromaDB. First, it creates a ChromaDB client and makes a new collection. Then it adds two short dummy documents about Manila and Hongkong to the collection, giving each one an ID. Behind the scenes, ChromaDB turns these documents into embeddings(i.e. numerical representation of the text) that capture their meaning. When you search with the query \"Query is about Philippines,\" ChromaDB compares this query's pattern to the stored documents' patterns and returns the closest matches. Since Manila is in the Philippines, the system should rank the Manila document higher in the results.  And it does -- the 'distances' key shows the 'Manila document' has a 'distance' of 0.52 to the query vs 'HK's 1.07."
